## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS

Built using HTML and EJS templates, this portfolio site includes a nice visual look at a software engineer's portfolio, as well as allows the submission of commission requests. Commission requests may be submitted using the form on the commissions page, and are then formatted via backend and sent to the engineer's inbox via nodemailer.

## Optimizations
This app is responsive across multiple screen sizes and works great for mobile viewing. Performance is optimized by keeping client side javascript files as small as possible

## Lessons Learned:
This was an enjoyable site to make. Becoming more familiar with Node.js and its middleware such as express and nodemailer was a learning experience. I am very pleased with Node.js documentation and the documentation of its middleware.
